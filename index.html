          <h1 id="tit_1" class="page">Focusing on MRSA</h1>
          <p>
            Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most notorious and ubiquitous
            bacterial pathogens, causing an incalculable number of simple skin
            infections worldwide each year, with hundreds of thousands to
            millions of more serious invasive infections. Among them,
            methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is recognized
            as a "superbug". MRSA can invade the mammary glands, mucous
            membranes, serous membranes, skin, and internal organs of humans
            and other animals (cattle, chickens, horses, dogs, pigs, and
            cats), causing serious disease and is a focal point of infection
            control worldwide.
          </p>
          <p>
            Food poisoning is a special case of acute Staphylococcus aureus
            infection, which is clinically manifested by gastrointestinal
            symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.
            Food poisoning caused by Staphylococcus aureus has been reported
            one after another, with food poisoning caused by Staphylococcus
            aureus accounting for about 25% of foodborne microbial food
            poisoning outbreaks.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the 2022 CARSS report, the national average detection
            rate of MRSA was 28.9%, a decrease of 0.5 percentage points
            compared with 2021, and there were some differences between
            regions, with the highest detection rate in Tibet Autonomous
            Region (44.0%) and the lowest in Liaoning Province (16.0%) (Figure
            2)<sup>1</sup>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, we urgently need to find more reasonable treatment and
            control methods. Synthetic biology offers a promising approach to
            this problem.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h1 id="tit_2" class="page">Current situation</h1>
          <p>
            Due to drug resistance, there are many limitations in the
            treatment of MRSA, and most of the current treatment methods are
            antibiotic treatment, such as vancomycin, ipamicin, clindamycin,
            etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the price of linezolid and vancomycin is relatively high,
            and long-term use may also cause bone marrow atrophy. Teicoplanin
            otorenal toxicity is lower than vancomycin, but the onset of
            action is slow, so it cannot be used as a first-line drug for
            severe infection. At the same time, the emergence of antimicrobial
            resistance has weakened the effectiveness of existing antibiotics.
            Prevention and treatment of MRSA infection are therefore crucial.
            At this time, antimicrobial peptides have been widely studied as a
            promising antimicrobial strategy.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h1 id="tit_3" class="page">Why super Eco.？</h1>
          <p>
            Recognizing the inherent limitations of current MRSA treatments,
            we embarked on a journey to harness the power of synthetic biology
            to create novel antimicrobial peptide therapies, and we aptly
            named our product super Eco. Our main goal is to engineer bacteria
            so that they can efficiently secrete antimicrobial peptides to
            specifically kill Staphylococcus aureus, and are equipped with a
            sensing switch and concentration feedback to make it biosafe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our motivation to address the shortcomings of existing MRSA
            treatments led us to explore the enormous potential of synthetic
            biology. A significant advantage of synthetic biology is its
            ability to precisely control downstream output signals by
            combining a myriad of different control elements. This inherent
            flexibility allows us to build customized control systems within
            the host organism, like assembling building blocks, for
            therapeutic purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The name of our product and mascot, super Eco., succinctly sums up
            the superiority of our project design. Our innovative approach to
            MRSA treatment is firmly rooted in the principles of synthetic
            biology, and we have successfully achieved our vision of the 6Cs
            of MRSA treatment: "Affordable, Accessible, Controllable,
            Sustainable, Potential, Competitive". The following sections will
            shed light on how our design achieves these goals.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h1 id="tit_4" class="page">Design</h1>
          <h2 id="tit_5" class="page">Chassis Organism</h2>
          <p>
            We chose E. coli Nissle 1917 as the chassis organism for our
            design. Escherichia coli Nissle 1917, often abbreviated as "Nissle
            1917", is a non-pathogenic strain of Escherichia coli (E. coli), a
            bacterium commonly found in the human gut. Unlike certain
            pathogenic strains of E. coli that can cause disease, Nissle 1917
            is considered safe for human consumption and has been extensively
            studied for its potential health benefits. This probiotic strain
            has been used to treat a variety of gastrointestinal disorders,
            including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel
            disease (IBD). We can effectively prevent food poisoning caused by
            MRSA by modifying Escherichia coli and taking it in the form of
            capsules to colonize the large intestine and respond to kill
            Staphylococcus aureus when it encounters Staphylococcus aureus.
          </p>
          <h2 id="tit_6" class="page">AMP design</h2>
          <p>
            We designed the AMP sequence including a fusion peptide composed
            of a specific targeting domain and a broad-spectrum AMP domain 2 +
            narrow-spectrum antibiotic3, so that it can specifically and
            efficiently kill Staphylococcus aureus. By reviewing the
            literature, we designed the corresponding sequences:
            LLGSLLKLLPKLLCASYFCRWWWLL-NH2 (C14-C19), which ensures that the
            antimicrobial peptide has excellent salt tolerance and
            biocompatibility.
          </p>
          <h2 id="tit_7" class="page">AMP circuit</h2>
          <p>
            In order to better achieve the goal of targeted
            anti-Staphylococcus aureus therapy and reduce antibiotic
            contamination, an efficient, accurate, sensitive and safe control
            system is necessary. We've tried at all stages of AMP synthesis.
            In the induction link, we used the quorum sensing system of
            Staphylococcus aureus to design a highly specific sensing switch,
            which is more accurate. In the initiation of expression, we
            designed a fast-response expression pathway with positive feedback
            characteristics by simultaneously expressing the CI protein and
            then relieving its own transcriptional repression through an
            inverter, which is more sensitive. In the stable expression state,
            we used the mechanism of self-negative regulation of CI protein to
            design a negative feedback regulatory pathway that can inhibit the
            expression level of AMP, which is safer.
          </p>
          <span class="bold page" id="tit_8">P/N feedback loop</span>
          <span>In order to effectively control the concentration of
            antimicrobial peptides, reduce the occurrence of drug resistance,
            and reduce the impact on the original intestinal microbes, we
            introduced the lysogenic pathway pathway pathway of bacteriophages
            to achieve positive feedback response and negative feedback
            regulation of AMP concentration.</span>
          <br /><span class="bold page" id="tit_9">Concentration module</span>
          <span>By introducing a key module in the Agr two-component system of
            Staphylococcus aureus, quorum sensing is used to achieve a
            sensitive linear response to Staphylococcus aureus
            concentrations.</span>
          <h2 id="tit_10" class="page">Biofilm</h2>
          <p>
            Due to the presence of some dormant Staphylococcus aureus cells
            (also known as persistent cells) that are encapsulated by its
            biofilm. These cells remain dormant during antimicrobial therapy
            and become active once treatment is stopped, causing chronic
            recurrent infections4. The colonization of engineered probiotics
            and the hydrogel secreted by the probiotics repair the intestinal
            barrier, weaken the colonization ability of Staphylococcus aureus
            that was originally colonized in the host and newly entered the
            body, enhance the killing ability of antimicrobial peptides, block
            the reproduction of Staphylococcus aureus, and remove dormant
            Staphylococcus aureus.
          </p>
          <h2 id="tit_11" class="page">Biosafety</h2>
          <p>
            We start from different levels of life and design biosafety
            modules based on different safety purposes, from the transcription
            of gene pathways to expression vectors, to suicide mechanisms at
            the individual level, and finally to the quorum sensing mechanism
            of populations. The abundance of regulatory means ensures that our
            drug system has no additional burden on the human body, and the
            use of the only probiotic in E. coli as a carrier greatly reduces
            the possibility of heterologous colonization and the risk of
            bacteria escaping to other parts of the body.

          <p>
            In the future, we will consider genome integration to ensure
            long-term validity and construct an orthogonal codon system9 to
            ensure that its genes are not transferred to other
            microorganisms<sup>9</sup>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will develop transpeptidase-mediated C-terminal PEGylation of
            intracellular antimicrobial peptides, which can achieve specific
            C-terminal PEGylation in host cells by biosynthesis of
            SortaseA-containing PEG compounds. This will further improve the
            stability of antimicrobial peptides without the development of
            drug resistance.

          <p>
            Also, we will further weaken or even eliminate adverse reactions
            by adding modules that neutralize enterotoxins. On the other hand,
            we are also extending it to the livestock industry to further
